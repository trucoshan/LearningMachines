# LearningMachines — Hacktoberfest 2025

A collaborative, no-frameworks (beyond NumPy) machine learning repo built from first principles.  
We implement core algorithms line-by-line to understand the math, not just call `.fit()`.

> Status: ✅ Linear Regression (from scratch) · ⏭️ Next: Linear Classifier (Perceptron / Logistic Regression)

## Goals

- Demystify ML by **implementing algorithms from scratch**.
- Build a **friendly collaboration space** for Hacktoberfest 2025.
- Keep code **minimal, readable, and well-documented**.
- Add **tests and examples** as we go.

## What’s Inside

- **Linear Regression (from scratch)**
  - Gradient Descent optimization
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization
  - Arbitrary feature dimensions
  - Minimal dependencies

## ToDo

> ToDo : Add **docstrings** and **comments** in model.py
> ToDo : Select an appropriate Dataset and try the LinearRegression from scratch model
> ToDo : Start with Linear Classifier - Perceptron
